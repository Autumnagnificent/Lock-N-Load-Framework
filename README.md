# Lock-N-Load-Framework

The Lock N Load Framework, which usually will be abbreviated to LnL, is a simple utility for creating tools from xml files. It uses an armature like system, where bodies represent bones that can be moved, which also update it's connected bones - hierarchy wise. It also features some other utility functions such as creating physical bodies from shapes - even if they are scaled.
